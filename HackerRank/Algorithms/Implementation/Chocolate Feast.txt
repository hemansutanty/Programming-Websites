Problem Statement

Little Bob loves chocolate, and he goes to a store with $N in his pocket. The price of each chocolate is $C. The store offers a discount: for every M wrappers he gives to the store, he gets one chocolate for free. How many chocolates does Bob get to eat?

Input Format: 
The first line contains the number of test cases, T. 
T lines follow, each of which contains three integers, N, C, and M.

Output Format: 
Print the total number of chocolates Bob eats.

Constraints: 
1≤T≤1000 
2≤N≤105 
1≤C≤N 
2≤M≤N

Sample input

3
10 2 5
12 4 4
6 2 2
Sample Output

6
3
5
Explanation 
In the first case, he can buy 5 chocolates with $10 and exchange the 5 wrappers to get one more chocolate. Thus, the total number of chocolates is 6.

In the second case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $12. However, it takes 4 wrappers to get one more chocolate. He can't avail the offer and hence the total number of chocolates remains 3.

In the third case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $6. Now he can exchange 2 of the 3 wrappers and get 1 additional piece of chocolate. Now he can use his 1 unused wrapper and the 1 wrapper of the new piece of chocolate to get one more piece of chocolate. So the total is 5.

#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    int t, n, c, m,y;
    int choclates,wrappers,exchangechoclates,leftwrappers;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while ( t-- )
    {
        scanf("%d%d%d",&n,&c,&m);
        int answer = 0,x=0; 
        choclates=n/c;wrappers=choclates;
        while(wrappers>=m){
            exchangechoclates=wrappers/m;
            leftwrappers=wrappers%m;
            choclates=choclates+exchangechoclates;
            wrappers=exchangechoclates+leftwrappers;
        }
        answer=choclates;
        printf("%d\n",answer);
    }
    return 0;
}
