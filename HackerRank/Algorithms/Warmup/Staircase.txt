Problem Statement

Your teacher has given you the task of drawing a staircase structure. Being an expert programmer, you decided to make a program to draw it for you instead. Given the required height, can you print a staircase as shown in the example?

Input 
You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.

Output 
Print a staircase of height N that consists of # symbols and spaces. For example for N=6, here's a staircase of that height:

     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######
Note: The last line has 0 spaces before it.

**//


//Solution

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */
    int n,i,j;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
        for(j=0;j<n-i-1;j++)
            {
            printf(" ");
        }
        for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
            {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
