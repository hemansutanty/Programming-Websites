/*
Given a rod of length ‘n’, we are asked to cut the rod and sell the pieces in a way that will maximize the profit. We are also given the price of every piece of length ‘i’ where ‘1 <= i <= n’.

Example:

Lengths: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Prices: [2, 6, 7, 10, 13]
Rod Length: 5

Let’s try different combinations of cutting the rod:

Five pieces of length 1 => 10 price
Two pieces of length 2 and one piece of length 1 => 14 price
One piece of length 3 and two pieces of length 1 => 11 price
One piece of length 3 and one piece of length 2 => 13 price
One piece of length 4 and one piece of length 1 => 12 price
One piece of length 5 => 13 price

This shows that we get the maximum price (14) by cutting the rod into two pieces of length ‘2’ and one piece of length ‘1’.
